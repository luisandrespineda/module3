# python-challenge
Repository for submitting Module 3 HW

This repository will be used to submit the homework for the python challenge.

For the PyBank portion of the assignment, the code is located under PyBank/Resources/pybank.py and the txt analysis is located under PyBank/Analysis/budget_analysis.txt

For the PyPoll portion of the assignment, the code is located under PyPoll/Resources/pypoll.py and hte txt analysis is located under PyPoll/Analysis/election_analysis.txt

A series of different sources were used for the homework including class presentation materials, 
class activities, help from a tutor as provided by the bootcamp, stackoverflow, chatgpt, and a few other coding message boards.

The tutor was instrumental in getting me started on the assignment. With his help, I made a lot of progress on the first half of the assignment, 
and was able to complete PyBank and PyPoll on my own thereafter.

Class presentation materials, class activities, and the tutor were used for creating the base of the code. 
Stack overflow, chatgpt and other coding message boards were used for troubleshooting the code.

I built on the concepts learned through the vba challenge, including newer concepts like lists and defintions.
